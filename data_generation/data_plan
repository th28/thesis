What are we averaging over

1.) stochastic raw material prices (not the parameters of the contracts but the underlying market spot price for a particular raw material)
2.) stochastic customer demand (each customer segment)

1.) In a single scenario:

for each raw material at each time period, we need a time series


2.) In a single scenario:

for each customer planning region, for each product, we need a time series


Most likely these time series should be somewhat correlated with each other.
